Thermite is a highly exothermic substance that, when activated, undergoes a chemical reaction generating temperatures exceeding 2400°C. Discovered in 1895 by Hans Goldschmidt, this reaction involves aluminium reducing iron oxide to produce iron and aluminium oxide, releasing a large amount of energy. The high temperatures generated by thermite make it useful in diverse applications, from incendiary bombs and grenades in warfare to metal reduction and exothermic welding, particularly in the railway industry. 
    </p>
    <p class="ex2">
Thermite has a high ignition temperature which makes it relatively stable and safe to store in large quantities. Its use in warfare highlights its dangerous potential, where it can cause widespread destruction, silently disable artillery, and instantly ignite fires. In industrial contexts, thermite's ability to quickly create durable welds is crucial for emergency repairs and situations where conventional welding methods are unavailable. 
    </p>
    <p class="ex2">
Despite these benefits, the extreme temperatures involved in thermite reactions necessitate strict safety measures to avoid accidents. This paper explores both the constructive and destructive uses of thermite, its roles in modern technology and warfare and addresses the risks associated.
    </p>

  <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
    <p class="ex1">
Thermite is a substance that when activated undergoes a massive exothermic chemical reaction called a thermite reaction, usually involving aluminium, iron, and oxygen.
    </p>
    <p class="ex1">
8Al + 3Fe2O3  2Fe3Al + 3Al2O3    <a href="#R">(Run-Hua Fan, (2006) pp. 129-131)</a>
    </p>
    <p class="ex1">
As the Aluminium reduces the Iron, large a quantity of energy is released. This reaction reaches temperatures of about 2400°C causing the products of the reaction to melt. <a href="#E">(Encyclopaedia Britannica (2024))</a>
    </p>
    <p class="ex1">
It was discovered in 1895 Hans Goldschmidt, German chemist, who experimented with using this reaction to reduce metals to create pure, carbon free products. This process does create carbon free metals, but trace amounts of Aluminium can be found instead. <a href="#E">(Encyclopaedia Britannica (2024))</a>
    </p>
    <p class="ex1">
Thermite's unique ability to produce extremely high temperatures with minimal equipment has led to its continued use in various fields where traditional methods of heating and welding are impractical. In addition to its industrial and military applications, thermite has been used in specialized fields such as emergency response, where it can quickly sever metal structures during rescue operations or disaster relief efforts. Its effectiveness in remote locations, where access to conventional welding tools or electricity may be limited, highlights its versatility and importance in urgent situations. Moreover, ongoing research into thermite’s properties has led to improved formulations for more efficient and controlled reactions, further enhancing its use in precision cutting, demolition, and even certain niche applications in manufacturing processes.
    </p>

  <h3 id="Analysis and discussion">Analysis and discussion</h3>
    <p class="ex1">
The easily produced high temperatures of thermite can be used in many areas. For example, its modern uses include, incendiary bombs, grenades, the reduction of metals, as a source of heat in welding iron, steel .etc, and in foundry work. <a href="#E">(Encyclopaedia Britannica (2024))</a>
    </p>
    <p class="ex1">
Thermite powder has high ignition temperature, meaning it is relatively stable and difficult to ignite. The ignition temperature is the temperature required to activate the reaction. Also known as activation energy. Because of this, large amounts of it can be stored in the same place without much risk of a reaction. Ignition methods usually involve using magnesium strips as a fuse. A sparkler is a commonly used, cheap option as the can burn slowly with some reaching temperatures of up to 2000°C. <a href="#H">(Helmenstine, A.M. (2019))</a> Enough to start the thermite reaction which ignition temperature can vairy depending on how fine and pure the powder is but usually around 1500°C although it can be as low as 500°C with really fine powder. Most thermite can get red hot or even melt without starting a reaction.
    </p>
    <p class="ex1">
A widespread modern-day use of thermite is in welding, also known as exothermic welding. It is known for is uses in welding railway tracks where a mould is placed around the two joined ends. Thermite is then poured in and the reaction started. This creates a localised temperature hight enough to melt and fuse the tracks. <a href="#S">(Star (Christchurch), (1906), pp3)</a> It was also used to quickly weld axles in trains and ships when they snapped and didn’t have the necessary tools to weld the axle properly so that they could get to a harbour or station. This however is only a temporary solution as thermite welds can easily include holes and areas of waste materials.
    </p>
    <p class="ex1">
Thermite has also been used in warfare. In grenades, <a href="#E">(Pike, J. (1998))</a> incendiary bombs and the destruction of important information and machinery when retreating. Incendiary bombs caused widespread destruction in many cities, primarily due to the fires ignited by the thermite. Cities with mainly wooden structures were particularly vulnerable. These bombs were mostly deployed during nighttime air raids, when bomb sights were ineffective, creating the need for the use of munitions that could devastate targets without the need for precise accuracy.
    </p>
    <p class="ex1">
Thermite has long been used in the military to disable artillery, a practice dating back to World War II, including during the Battle of Pointe du Hoc in Normandy. Unlike explosive charges, thermite permanently disables artillery without creating noise, making it useful in operations requiring silence. This is achieved by inserting one or more armed thermite grenades into the barrel of a tank, hole, crevice or breach. This would cause the breech to weld shut and renders the weapon unable to be loaded or fired. <a href="#N">(New York. (1994)) </a>

  <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
    <p class="ex1">
As you can see in the image above, thermite has the potential to be very dangerous due to the extreme temperatures it generates during its reaction. While its potential for extremely high temperatures is what makes it useful in various applications, it also presents significant risks, particularly in military settings. In warfare, thermite has been employed in incendiary bombs and grenades, causing efficient widespread destruction and disabling of enemy equipment and infrastructure. Its ability to ignite fires and silently disable artillery makes it an invaluable but hazardous tool on the battlefield.
    </p>
    <p class="ex1">
On the other hand, thermite’s use in welding highlights its constructive applications. In industries like railway construction and emergency ship repairs, thermite is utilised to quickly create durable welds in situations where conventional equipment may not be available. It’s high ignition temperature making it relatively safe to handle. Despite these beneficial uses, the high temperatures involved in thermite welding require careful handling and safety precautions to prevent accidents.
